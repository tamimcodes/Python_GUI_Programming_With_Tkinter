# Python GUI Programming With Tkinter

This repository contains my practice code and projects from the book Python GUI Programming with Tkinter by Alan D. Moore.

The book follows a project-based learning approach — starting from simple Tkinter syntax and gradually introducing more advanced concepts for building cross-platform GUI applications.

📚 **Topics Covered**

✅ Getting started with Tkinter basics

✅ Layouts, widgets, and event handling

✅ Organizing code with classes

✅ Reducing user error with validation and automation

✅ Planning for application expansion

✅ Maintaining cross-platform compatibility

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

Python (3.12)

Tkinter (standard Python GUI library)

PostgreSQL (database)


**This repo is a personal journey through the book, practicing each concept and building progressively complex Tkinter applications.**
